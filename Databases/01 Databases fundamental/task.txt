Analyze the “Bank” database model (see below). Perform the following tasks:
1. Do you see any imperfections in its infological and datalogical levels? If yes, name them.

* Office and Site page don't have relations with others tables
* Account Owner should have Account ID to get relations between them
* Status don't have Account ID, so they don't have relations.
* Both Transaction don't have Account ID, so they don't have relations

2. What questions do you want to ask the Customer to improve the models? Write down these
questions.

* Do you want to have office addresses where client have account?
* Should user want to see in which offices it has accounts?
* Do you want to see what accounts make transactions by owner per month?

3. Try representing the “Bank” database model using graph and hierarchy schemas.
